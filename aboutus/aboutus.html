          <p class="font-weight-bold">The East West University Telecommunications Club </p>
          <p class="font-weight-normal">The East West University Telecommunications Club (EWUTC) was 
            formed by a group of enthusiastic students in early 2006. The objective of the club is to 
            disseminate telecommunication related ideas among the students. EWUTC is rapidly making an 
            impression within the University as one of its most active student run clubs
              Clubâ€™s primary goal is to help the students blend the academic theories that they study in 
              classrooms with innovative ideas that result in their mind as a byproduct and thereby put 
              forward something new. The club assists the students in putting to practical use the lessons 
              that they study from books. Since its inception, EWUTC has organized numerous workshops and 
              seminars as a part of its knowledge disseminating process and these were often presided over 
              by eminent telecom experts of the industry. The Club has also taken students to field trips in 
              the industry through which they have had a chance to see practical applications of whatever they
               come across as theories in the classroom. In addition, the club never takes a step back in 
               engaging its members in non-academic activities such as arranging picnics and excursions that
                serves in providing the students with a break from the continuous influx of knowledge that
                 they are always subjected to and thus furnishes them with the much-needed recreation.</p>
